## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Motorâ€‘vehicle collisions are one of the leading causes of injury and property loss in Chicago. This project analyzes the City of Chicago's Traffic Crashes data to understand where, when, and why these incidents occur. The aim is to provide evidence-based insights that can help make Chicago roads safer for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike.

- According to the latest figures, Chicago logged about 112,000 crash reports in 2024, and nearly 30,000 additional crashes by the first week of April 2025
- This project leverages the publicly available Traffic Crashes dataset from the City of Chicago Data Portal
- Our analysis includes crash records from 2020 onwards, focusing on recent patterns and trends
